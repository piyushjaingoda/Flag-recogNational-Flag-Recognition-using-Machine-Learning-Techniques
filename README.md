This project is to tackle the problem of national flags prediction with the use of artificial intelligence techniques and algorithms.
National Flag Recognition using machine learning techniques will be able to predict the name of a country when provided with the flag image of the country. National flag recognition will be based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model will use the tensorflow library which is used for machine learning applications like neural network.
The idea behind the selection of Convolutional neural networks over other popular algorithms is to implement the algorithm on a smaller dataset, as it mainly works on big data. The architecture of Convolutional Neural networks in National flag recognition will consist of: 
•    Input layer 
•    8 hidden layers   
•    Output layer. 
The dataset in the project consists of 290 countries, where the dataset is divided into training set and validation set for better accuracy. Each country has 80 images of its flags in the training set and 20 images of its flags in the validation set. One can get the image of the flag of a country when he knows the country name from the internet, but getting the name of the country from its flag is not an easy task. National flag recognition will overcome this problem by predicting the name of the country when the flag image is given as an input to the model.
